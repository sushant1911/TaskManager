# TaskManager
SpringBoot application  for creating  task  as all task management related work .
outline the steps and components you'll need to implement in your Spring Boot application to achieve the desired functionality:

Receive POST Request to Create a Task:

Implement a REST controller in your Spring Boot application to handle POST requests for creating tasks.
Extract task details from the request body and save them to the MySQL database using Spring Data JPA.
Save Task in Android Local Database:

In the response to the Android app's POST request, send the created task details.
Save the task details in the local database of the Android app using SQLite or Room Persistence Library.
Publish Task Created Event:

Implement an event publisher in your Spring Boot application to publish an event when a task is created.
This event will be consumed by interested components, such as the notification service.
Notification Service:

Develop a notification service that listens for task created events.
Upon receiving the event, send a push notification to the Android app using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or another push notification service.
Scheduler for Task Alarms:

Implement a scheduler in your Spring Boot application to manage task alarms.
Periodically check the database for tasks with approaching deadlines.
When a task's deadline is imminent, trigger an alarm event.
Task Statuses:

Define task statuses (e.g., pending, in progress, completed) in your database schema.
Implement functionality to update task statuses based on user actions or other events.
Component Overview:
REST Controller: Handles incoming HTTP requests from the Android app.
Service Layer: Contains business logic for creating tasks, managing notifications, and handling alarms.
Event Publisher: Publishes task created events to notify other components.
Notification Service: Sends push notifications to the Android app.
Scheduler: Manages task alarms and triggers alarm events when necessary.
Database Layer: Interacts with the MySQL database to store and retrieve task data.
Additional Considerations:
Ensure proper error handling and validation in your REST controller to handle invalid requests gracefully.
Implement security measures, such as JWT authentication, to protect your API endpoints.
Optimize database queries and use appropriate indexing for efficient data retrieval.
Test your application thoroughly, including unit tests for individual components and integration tests for end-to-end functionality.
